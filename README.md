# :abacus: iOS Calculator Application

## Description

iOS Calculator Application. This project was created following the FrontEnd Masters tutorial as part of their online FrontEnd Bootcamp.

It is built in HTML and CSS with interaction and math made possible thanks to Javascript.

I loved working on this project as it was my first Javascript full application tutorial and it helped me better undestrand the use of functions and the if/else.
